Car Sales Prediction

Introduction
This project aims to predict car sales using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical car sales data and build predictive models to forecast future sales. This project employs data preprocessing, feature selection, and several machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.


Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as:
- Date
- Model
- Manufacturer
- Price
- Sales Volume... (other relevant features)

Model Training and Evaluation
The model training and evaluation process is detailed in the Jupyter notebook. We use various machine learning algorithms including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score.

The Random Forest model performed the best with the lowest MAE and MSE.
